In March of this year, I started corresponding with new HTC member Gokulakrishna Sudharsan. We discovered we had similar interests and became friends. One result of this was a decision to work on a podcast that would share Gokul’s interest in Free as in Libre/open source software with HTC’s membership and the world beyond.

The conversation that is the basis of the podcast took place in late June on [jitsi.org](https://jitsi.org). Gokul helped me with the initial edit, provided the list of references, and transcribed most of the recording. Michele Minno added the text about the forum that I read at the beginning, provided the guitar music, and edited the recording to make it listener worthy. It was a team effort that took about a month.

This project expresses two of HTC’s main characteristics: to work for the social good; and to educate and teach people to use technology wisely. It’s been my great pleasure to work with Gokul and Michele, and I hope that many others will benefit from our efforts.
