Our ongoing community activities are divided into long-running Programs where our members collaboratively work on crowdsourced initiatives.

Of course, any non-members can contribute just as well. Though - if you are as concerned as us about the impact of technology on our society - we heartily invite you to [join our community](/join/)!

## Awareness Program

In this space our members collaborate to create (social) media campaigns and other deliverables that aim to inform the wider public on the problems that come with modern technology and the need to address these by applying Humane Technology. We raise awareness about solutions. The discussions about our campaigns takes place on our community forum in the [Awareness program](https://community.humanetech.com/c/focus/awareness-program) category.
