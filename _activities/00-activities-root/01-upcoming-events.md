### 2019-07-30: Humane Tech London Meetup #4

Join us for another night of entertaining talks and lively discussions about how we make technology work better for us. If you’re in London, we’d love to see you there. Talks range from ethical considerations and the digital attention crisis to building humane tech products and individual digital wellbeing.

The community is super friendly and our three speakers are from government, a mindful startup and a responsible tech design agency.

**Where**: Futurice Ltd. 26-28 Underwood St · London · London<br>
**When**: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM BST<br>
