## About

Campaigns are at the heart of the Awareness Program. They are where members team up to plan coordinated activities. Each **Campaign** has its own goals and deliverables to be produced when the campaign executes. Each campaign defines its own campaign strategy. Campaigns are less abstract concept than a campaign themes, and they can be short-lived, only executing to produce their deliverables and then finish.

In addition to the Campaigns displayed in this page, additional campaign proposals may be found in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/humanetech-community/awareness-program/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acampaign-proposal) of the Github repository associated with the Awareness Program.

Every Humane Tech Community member can suggest new Campaigns by posting in the [Awareness program](https://community.humanetech.com/c/awareness-program).
