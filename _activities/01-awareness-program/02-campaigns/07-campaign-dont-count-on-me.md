## Summary

<!-- Clear and concise explanation in 1-3 lines of text. -->

Raise awareness on the role of metrics (n. of followers/friends/likes/ ..)  in social media, and take action to have them removed.

## Goals

<!-- Bullet list of the intended effects of the campaign, separated by empty lines. -->

- Raise awareness with the public how metrics in social media are unnecessary and only serve to increase their dependency on them.

- Force social media companies to acknowledge that users are against counters in social media profiles and feeds.

- Organize frivolous actions for social media users to participate in, to send clear signals to the platform operators and apply public pressure to change.



## Audience

<!-- The demographic audience the campaign is targeted to. -->

- All people that use social media as they are now or would use them if they were more human and metrics-free.

## Success criteria

<!-- (optional) Bullet list detailing how success is measured. -->

- Design actions that are continuated by social media users without the need for community attention
- Other success criteria should be defined based on the deliverables we create.

## Retrospective

<!-- (optional) Analysis of results after campaign has ended, to see if success criteria were met, and to learn lessons for future campaigns. Use the placeholder text is no retrospective was held yet. Add a date indicator if possible (e.g. 'after 3 months', '24-11-2018'). -->

- No retrospective has been held yet. The first retrospective is planned at [retrospective date].

## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

No more n. of followers, n. of likes and so on. It’s a simple but powerful change. it’s the core of the addiction: we see numbers, our brain makes automatic comparisons, we ultimately suffer and strive for more dopamine when the counter increments. In the ideal scenario envisioned by this campaign, social media users would continue to see if someone likes or follows, but no aggregation on users’ actions would be made (how many users did something). That’s where masses of strangers weirdly affect our expectations and our rewards.

## Deliverables

<!-- Sub-headers with the planned deliverables and their summaries. Update this later to reflect changes.  The second sub-header gives an example. -->





### [Picture]: [Infographics](deliverable1-url)

Some infographics about what a social media without counters would be like.

### [Video]: [Video about social media with no counters](deliverable2-url)

A video about what interactions on such a social media would be like.

### [Social media campaign]: [Don't count on me hour (or day)](deliverable3-url)

Plan a boycott (one hour, a whole day?), in which all people adhering don’t like any new post nor follow any new member on their preferred social media, so that they don’t make any counter increase. This could be the only way to really make a little damage to social media companies and perhaps let them notice us…

## Strategy

<!-- Outline the (draft) strategy required to attain the success criteria (one or more paragraphs of text, use formatting - like lists - where appropriate). Use this placeholder text if this section is not needed:

- This campaign does not require a strategy. Strategy is defined on the Theme, or in Deliverables.
 -->

- This is a complex campaign. Besides the (not too long) description, provide a link to a separate [strategy document](campaigns/[campaign-folder]/campaign-strategy.md).

- Additionally you can point to general strategy resources in the `/strategy` folder.

## Funding

<!-- (optional) Financial requirements, required budget, ways to obtain funds (keep it short, couple of paragraphs, some bullets). If necessary link to separate detailed funding document. Use the placeholder text if no funding is required. -->

- No funding is required to execute this campaign.

## Milestones

<!-- (optional) Bullet list of past and future milestones for the campaign. Or placeholder bullet "No milestones have been defined." -->



## Resources

<!-- (optional) Links to relevant folders, files and external information, or leave the placeholder text. -->

- Cognitive and behavioural science pattern that are implemented in social media (see [forum listing](https://community.humanetech.com/t/2951))
