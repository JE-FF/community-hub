## Description

<!-- A longer, more elaborate description (one or more paragraphs of text) -->

'Eventful' is an ongoing campaign that defines the Events Program of the community.

First goal of the campaign is to merge the efforts of all existing Meetup groups into one unified activity. The HTC has existed as 'only' a forum for the first 9 months after its launch. During this time a total of of [29 initiatives](https://community.humanetech.com/t/3017) have started to form meetup chapters all around the world. This has led to:

- 10 active CHT meetup chapters have been erected
- 6 active meetup chapters that are not (directly) affiliated to CHT
- 1 meetup chapter that has been disbanded again
- 12 initiatives to create a meetup group, that have not materialized yet.

Unification starts by rallying current meetup organizers, and providing a common home for meetup chapters on the community website. Parallel to that we'll create a common brand image, and document guidelines and best-practices for meetup / event organization. On the forum there will be spaces to ideate exciting event topics, and coordinate event organization.

## Deliverables
