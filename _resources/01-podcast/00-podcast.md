## HTC podcast

Welcome to the podcast series of the Humane Technology Community.

### Episode n. 1

The first in a series, this podcast covers free, libre, open-source software (FLOSS) and the creation of browser addons to improve user security and privacy. Among the humane-tech principles discussed are the following:

- The FLOSS movement expands and strengthens human rights, among them the right to knowledge and transparency.
- Sharing code (under freedom-respecting licenses) is a global educational endeavour
- HTC is itself an example of working and leading in the open.
